# TOP-Mastermind
Mastermind in Ruby


## Rules:
12 attempts to guess a 4 digit code
inform Codebreaker when each digit exists but does not match position
inform Codebreaker when each digit exists and matches position

## Build steps
1. Build the game assuming the computer randomly selects the secret code and the human player must guess them. Remember that you need to give the proper feedback on how good the guess was each turn!
2. Now refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.
3. Build it out so that the computer will guess if you decide to choose your own secret code. You may choose to implement a computer strategy that follows the rules of the game or you can modify these rules.

## Current State
User as guesser functionality is complete.
PC as guesser functionality is incomplete. Currently provides 3 standard guesses and then attempts random numbers.
